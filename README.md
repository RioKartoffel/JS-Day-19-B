Button Ripple Effect

The HTML code defines the structure of the webpage, including the button element and references to the stylesheet and JavaScript files.

The CSS code defines the styles for the button, including the background color, font size, and padding. It also sets up the layout for the webpage and specifies the animation for the ripple effect.

The JavaScript code adds an event listener to each button with the "ripple" class. When a button is clicked, the function creates a span element with the "circle" class, positions it at the click location, and appends it to the button element. The span element then grows to create a ripple effect, and it is removed after half a second using the setTimeout function.

Overall, these codes work together to create an interactive and visually appealing button on a webpage.
